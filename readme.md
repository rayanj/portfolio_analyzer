Summary
I am working on a python project that analyzes my portfolio, gives me a facility to aggregate on different attributes and levels of my portfolio like sector and funds. It also shows me the risk numbers at these aggregated levels.
 For example, let say we have a hypothetical portfolio of 5 stocks and 5 ETFs:
   Stocks                   ETFs
symbol	quantity		symbol	quantity
AAPL 	    10		    ARKK	   20
ABNB	    20		    VOO		    5
AMZN	    2		    SPY		    5
TSLA	    10			SRET       10
UBER	    20			XLK		    3
